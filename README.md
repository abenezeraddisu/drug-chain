# drug-chain
an interesting problem - suppose we are given a file containing 2 names. The first one is a new drug addict; the latter is who the one who introduced the former to drugs.  Task is to construct a binary tree that starts with a head "First User", whose children recursively are the new drug addicts, so the leaves of the BST are the latest addicts. For extra fun it is done in C.
